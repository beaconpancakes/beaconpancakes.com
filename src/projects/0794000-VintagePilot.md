I recently visited an art exhibition of a great Spanish painter named [Ram√≥n Casas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Casas). Looking at the beautiful way he painted women, I wanted to make something similar, using my style instead. A strong and funny woman who can achieve anything!

So I decided to make a female vintage pilot based on old photographs of WW2 pilots. I also tried to get an appealing mixture of several textures (hair, leather, smoke). I finished it quickly, with the magic of the transparent brushes of **Photoshop** and I am particularly pleased with the blonde hair.

I hope you enjoy the process!
