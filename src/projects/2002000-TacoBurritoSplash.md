This drawing is a splash illustration that I created for a personal project called **"Taco & Burrito, A Tex-Mex Adventure"**, settled in a Western-like world with anthropomorphic animals. I loved the project and, although it never came to an end, I enjoyed it very much.

This illustration is the presentation for the main characters, Taco and Burrito, a luchador enmascarado (masked professional wrestler) and a gunslinger, respectively.
