Maybe some of you recognize **Maximus**, the character from the featured film **Tangled**. This drawing was a study sheet I made as a styling exercise for a character design subject in the **Art & Visual Design in video game master course** of **U-Tad**. The teacher assigned each of the students one Disney character and a range of expressions, and we had to work with it. In my case, I had the complex task of creating a 3D character in 2D, so I used a classic Disney drawing (with the colored line and everything).
