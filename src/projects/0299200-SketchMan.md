A lot of things happened in the last few months. My family and I **managed to move to the United States**, and we had had a busy time adapting to the new country and the new situation. If you have visited my website before January 2021, you would see many differences, because I also have been working hard to update it. Now there is also a [blog section](/blog/) where I can write about my American adventures (for now, just in Spanish, sorry!). Please, be sure to check it out!

Since I have been busy, I had have little time for drawing just for fun. And I was craving for painting, especially since I got a new **Cintiq Pro** and I needed to test it out! I have been doing a lot of research on watercolor-like brushes in Photoshop for a commission and having a lot of fun with it. This drawing is a quick sketch that takes roughly one hour and a half and was created with these same watercolor brushes set. The initial goal was to make it in just one color shade, but I started to play with splashes of colors and the blending of the Photoshop layers. I loved the result and decided to stop drawing further because I was already fairly happy with the textures, the strokes from the brushes, and the shading.

By the way, I drew this without any references. But in the process, he started to reminds me of a character in [**The Expanse** show](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) played by actor **Wes Chatham**. Maybe this is an unconscious fanart!

I hope you enjoy it!
