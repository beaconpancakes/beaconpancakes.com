Several years ago, I started a personal project called **"Taco & Burrito, A Tex-Mex Adventure"** and I made concepts that you can see in this portfolio (here for [Burrito](/projects/burrito-character-design/) and here for [Taco and Burrito](/projects/taco-burrito/)).

Currently I am doing a lot of work in 3D and I though that it would be fun to redo the character of Burrito but now in 3D. So I have done all the process of modelling and mapping in **Autodesk 3ds Max**, and the textures with **Photoshop**. I posed the model with a simple biped and that is all! It was really fun to do and I have learned a lot in the process.
