As I told in the previous entry, I recently got married! But, aside from the lovely video game, I also did a lot of design work for printing!

First of all, I designed the menus for the lunch and the dinner and some signage to help the guests with tips, information and even a game.

We also had a photo booth, and we decided to personalize the frames of the photographs and the cover for the album with my own designs.  

And, of course, we had to have welcome packs for the guests! They included a booklet with activities and games about the bride and groom (absolutely one of the best ideas!), a personalized sticker and a personalized pin. Also, to add something sweet, cookies with illustrations printed on edible paper!

I used a combination of Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign, where I could work fine and agile. It was a large amount of work, but I think it is worth the effort. For once, is fun to do designs for print and enjoy the designs in real objects!

Still, if you have more curiosity about my wedding, you can check our [wedding website] (https://pinkotters.com/).
