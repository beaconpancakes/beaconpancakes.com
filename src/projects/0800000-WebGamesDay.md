These are a poster and a stand-up banner design I have made for a free video games event. It is the first time this event is organized, but it has many interesting talks and VR demos.

The hard part of the design was the typography and the mood, like an old arcade game but somehow more actual. I think the final design is working, and it is clear enough, so I'm happy with it!
