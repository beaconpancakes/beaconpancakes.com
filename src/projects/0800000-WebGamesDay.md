Poster and stand-up banner design I've made for a free video games event. It is the first time it's organized, but it has a lot of interesting talks and VR demos. I think it's really nice.

The hard part of the design was the typography and the mood, like an old arcade game but somehow more actual. I think the final design is working and it is clear enough, so I'm happy with it!
