My new thing!

I absolutely love Axolotls; I love their skin and the fins and that cute smile on their faces! They are so strange that seem like little underwater aliens. So thinking about that, the image came to my mind and I decided to paint it. Everything is made entirely in Photoshop, and although it took me more time than expected, it made me really happy.

Since many people don't know Axolotls, please check [here](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambystoma_mexicanum) if you want to know more about them.
