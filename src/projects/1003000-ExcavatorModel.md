I did this excavator model and mapping in **Autodesk 3d max** for the **Art & Visual Design in video game master course** of **U-Tad**. It could seem like a simple model, but the arm had a lot of complexity. The caterpillar track was easier to make than it could seem, and I was pleased with the results.
