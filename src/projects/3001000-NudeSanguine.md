I made this drawing of a live model when I was studying Fine Arts in 2004-2005. It is made just with sanguine and white chalk on paper, and it measures 100 x 70 cms.

This one was one of my favorite drawings of those times. That was mainly for the line shading and how I worked on the right foot (at that time, feet were like my "Achilles' heel").

Today, I search for other things when I draw live models, more about gesture and speed, but I still think this is a worthy example of linework.
