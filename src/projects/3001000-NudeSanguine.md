I made this drawing of a live model when I was studying Fine Arts in 2004-2005, only with sanguine and chalk.

This was one of my favorite drawings of those times, for the line shading, for the use of white chalk for the lights and for the right foot (at that time, feet were like my "Achilles' heel").

Today, I searched different things when I draw live models, more about gesture and speed, but I still think this is a good work.
