I decided to take a challenge, so I searched among my favorite 2D artists and then tried to imitate their art styles. And who is the best model but myself? How could these artists have designed my face and also reflect my personality? I usually don't make self-portraits, but the idea was fun, and I have enjoyed it a lot!

For the first few days, I published in a couple of places the drawings without the artists' names. This way, people could try to guess who they were. Now, everybody can see them and go to check their wonderful artwork.

**Fun Fact**: Artists come from EEUU, Canada, France, and Japan, and there are five women!

I hope you like them!
