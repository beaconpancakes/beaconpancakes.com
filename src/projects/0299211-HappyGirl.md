I had been testing **Affinity Photo** for a while, making some sketches and some paintings, and I realized that I had **Affinity Designer** a little bit neglected. Envisioning a project with vectors is indeed harder for me, at least concerning the style and the lighting. I enjoyed more a bright cartoon style with simple illumination, so I always try to stick to this ideal. And improvise later if the picture needs it, of course.

This time, I was looking to paint more girls, like the ones reading I had been working a month ago. I also wanted to work a little bit more on curly hair because I find it quite laborious and wanted to try to simplify it. Also, I wanted to make something happy and bright, with lots of pinks or yellows. Then, I visualized a little girl with a cunning smile and a lovely pink tee and started to work straight into **Affinity**.

I have found **Affinity Designer** intuitive and quite natural in editing vectors and shapes, although I found the gradients more complicated than I would have liked. Also, I missed a couple of advanced tools for shapes transformation and deformation. Except for these things, it has a great tool's collection, and it is quick and easy. I could replicate my standard vector workflow, in which I repeat and mix layers of subtle gradients, with little problems.

I enjoyed the process a lot. I am highly satisfied with the overall colors, the skin tones, and the balance of the multicolored windmill toy. I also enjoyed making the embroidery of the tee. At first, I thought it was too much information, but when I put everything together, I loved the texture. I am also happy with the simplicity of the silhouette of the hair, in contrast with the complexity of the layers of color.

I hope you enjoy it!
