Quick study about rocks and vegetation in the north of my hometown, Madrid, close to the mountains. There is a place called **La Pedriza** that have really interesting and remarkable granite rock formations. These stones also have unusual colours for granite, like orange, which combines beautifully with the dark green of the pines and the yellow of the summer grass. I wanted to draw a quick environment so I made use of a familiar landscape.

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Pedriza) you can found more information about this place.

Hope you like.
