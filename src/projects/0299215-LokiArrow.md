I had read a lot of good things about **Affinity** and I liked what you can get with it. A couple of weeks ago, when I realise that **Affinity Designer** and **Affinity Photo** have a 50% discount, I just bought both.

I started to test **Affinity Photo** brushes, and I make a sketch of a man with a pencil-like brush. I liked a lot, and then I began to work on the head and the hair and to polish lines. And little by little, maybe inspired by the mocking expression, I started to see that I was portraying the Norse god Loki.

I have always been an enthusiast of mythology. I love Greek, Roman, Egyptian and Norse mythology, maybe because of the paintings, sculptures and architecture that have these myths inspiration. And Loki is one of the more intriguing, unusual and amusing characters you can find.  I had seen many interpretations and re-interpretations of Loki, but it was about time I make my own! It was also an opportunity to look for cool Viking references!

I decided to follow the same process I would make with a traditional drawing: pencil, ink, colour and effects. This way I could also test different brushes. Since in the sketch he was looking downwards, I thought it would be great to put in his hands the arrow that he made to kill [Baldr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr). I drew the arrow and also added references for Norse culture, like the runes, the whetstones or the brooch. I enjoyed the pencil and ink brushes because they feel and look very realistic and were easy to work with. I had more problems with the brushes for the shading because it was hard to find one with the features I had in mind. But in the end, I am happy with the result of the textures and the brushes. I like also the cartoon style, I think it suits the character and the pose!

I hope you like it too!
