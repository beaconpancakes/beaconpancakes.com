These are a couple of sketches of girls reading, casually. I wanted to draw something not very detailed, but with lots of color.

At first, I roughly wanted to draw something blue and cold. I started to do sketches in **Affinity** and the first girl comes quickly and naturally, with just the line. But I did not want the line this time, so I turned to **Photoshop** and started to work on the colors. I soon forget the line and defined the shapes, trying to find a cartoon-like style. I did not want the usual pretty girl! The shading was smooth and gratifying, so I decided to make another sketch. This time, I chose the concepts warm and orange, and I thought it had to oppose the previous one. So I made her reading on a smartphone and put her the same clothes, like a school uniform, to have something in common.

I think there is a story here, between these two. Maybe I should investigate it?

I hope you enjoy it!
