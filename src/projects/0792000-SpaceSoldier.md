Concept art of a soldier from a futurist world with his nice space suit! This is a sample of how I paint in 2D like it was a 3D model. This is something I have always love to do, because and I have the opportunity to play with a lot of different textures and lights. It was a ton of work, but I am really happy with the result (although he end by the chest...) and all the character concept.

To make it, I used only **Adobe Photoshop** and a lot of references for the skin tones and the metal reflections.
