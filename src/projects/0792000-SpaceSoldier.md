This one is one concept art of a soldier from a futurist world with his nice space suit! It is a sample of how I can paint in 2D like it was a 3D model. I have always loved to paint this way because I can play with many different textures and lights. It was a ton of work, but I am very happy with the result (although he ends by the chest...) and the character mood.

To make it, I used only **Adobe Photoshop** and a lot of references for the skin tones and the metal reflections.
