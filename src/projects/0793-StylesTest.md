I decided to take a challenge, so I searched among my favorite 2D artists and then I tried to imitate their art styles. And who is best model but myself? How could these artists had designed my own face and also my personality? I usually don't make self-portraits, but the idea was really funny. And I have enjoyed a lot!

So, for the first days, I am going to put this here but without the names of the artists. It is really hard to find all the names, but I am sure that some people would feel happy to try.

**Hint**: the artists come from EEUU, Canada, France and Japan, and there are five women.

Good luck!
