Lately, I have seen a lot of 3D artists making beautiful models of food, so I thought I could do my own models too! But I wanted to model something real, with significance to me, not a plain good-looking model. I reviewed some of my photographs looking for inspiration, and reviewing some of Tokyo I found the one. It was a croissant taiyaki with a matcha latte for breakfast! The taiyaki was a funny and lovely treat, and the colours mixture of golden orange dough and green tea was gorgeous. Also, there was plenty of textures for the contrast. I simply had to do it!

Sincerely, I had a great time with this model! I made it with Blender because I wanted something fast and with a good performance for materials. It was also a chance for me to do more 3D art, apart from all my 2D work.

Hope you enjoy it!
