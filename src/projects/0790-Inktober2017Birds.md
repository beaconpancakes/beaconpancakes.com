October is the time for [Inktober](https://www.mrjakeparker.com/inktober-1/)! But to make a draw every day, with a full-time job and the housework, is exhausting for me. So I resolved the best way I can participate was making little and easy drawings.

I have always love birds and spot them when I am in the country always makes me happy, so it seemed like a good theme. I started by drawing in an old sketchbook my favourite bird, a great tit (in Spanish, the name is _carbonero_), in a funny cartoon style, with **technical pens** and **colored pencils**. After that, I only had to continue! I decided only to draw birds that could be found in Spain, birds that could be easy for me to see someday. And I love the names of some of them in Spanish!

It was easy to make these lovely little drawings, but still, it is hard to draw every day!
