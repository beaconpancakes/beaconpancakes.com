This drawing is a manga character design I made as a styling exercise for a character design subject in the **Art & Visual Design in video game master course** of **U-Tad**. I first drew it in class using just a pencil, and later at home, I scanned and colored it with Photoshop. Since manga style is not my usual technique, I had a good time figuring out how everything should work. I also tried to make a style similar to the video game **The World Ends with You**.
