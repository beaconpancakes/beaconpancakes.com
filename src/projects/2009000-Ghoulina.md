This drawing is an illustration inspired by a psychobilly party poster I made. It was made originally in pencil and colored digitally with Photoshop. I liked the character a lot because she was one cool and stylish gal. So, sometime after, I decided to redo the whole drawing in vectors. Illustrator was then the perfect option.

The name "Ghoulina" in the drawing's title is a tribute to the psychobilly band Ghoulina and the Skeletons
