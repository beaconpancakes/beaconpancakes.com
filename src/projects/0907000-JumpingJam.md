Characters, enemies and art made for the mobile game Jumping Jam, iteration from
the game Jumpsters, developed by **HeYou Games**.

The assets were first made in Adobe Illustrator, then retouched
in Adobe Photoshop, exported to 3D meshes in Autodesk 3ds Max, and finally exported to Unity.

I made all the art and processes, from concept to final implementation.
