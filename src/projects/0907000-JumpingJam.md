Here you can see some characters, enemies, and general art I made for the mobile game **Jumping Jam**, developed by **HeYou Games**.

It was an iteration from our previous game [Jumpsters](/projects/jumpsters-game/). We use a pretty similar pipeline, but we change the style (we added gradients and make everything more colorful), and we improved the pipeline to make it quicker. We still used **Adobe Illustrator**, **Adobe Photoshop**, and **Autodesk 3ds Max**, but we could reduce to the minimum previous problems and develop faster and better.

As the only artist in the team, I created all the art in the game, from concept to final implementation. Also, I wrote all the processes and pipelines.
