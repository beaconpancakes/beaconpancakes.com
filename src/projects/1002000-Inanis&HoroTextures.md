These are some of the textures I created for the final project of **Art & Visual Design in video game master course** of **U-Tad**.

The final project was to create from zero a video game for mobile platforms. They set up several groups of students from different disciplines (art, design, and code), and we had to work together. The name of our game was **Inanis & Horo**,  and we developed it with **Project Anarchy Engine**. I made these textures with Adobe Photoshop, and we put them in the assets in **Autodesk 3ds Max**.

We decided to use lovely and colorful handpainted textures, remembering us games as **Zelda: Windwaker**.
