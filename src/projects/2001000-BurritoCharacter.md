This is some character concept art, that I created for a personal project called **"Taco & Burrito, A Tex-Mex Adventure"**, settled in a Western-like world with anthropomorphic animals. I loved the project and, although it never came to an end, I enjoyed it very much.

Here I am drawing one of the two main characters, a gunslinger ferret called Burrito. It was a lot of fun to draw!
