Lately, it has been a stressful time, so I wanted to draw something easy and stress reliever. I started to draw in Photoshop with an ink-like brush, and after a few tries, the strokes began to transform in the wrinkled face of a lovely old woman with an opened mouth. After that, all the scene came quickly to my mind, so I put the soup bowl and chose the rounded form of the body. The baby was the last thing I added, thinking in the contrast of the ages and inspired by a picture of my baby nephew. Once I finished the ink, I decided to colour the drawing with a watercolour appearance, so I created a textured brush and imitated the technique.

I did a lot of watercolours when I was studying, and I loved the look of the dashes of colour, although these watercolours were slow to create. I am really happy that I could simulate the technique digitally, and I think it is a method I could use again in the future.

Hope you like it too!
