I made these mock-ups in **Adobe Illustrator** for a dismissed puzzle game by **HeYou Games**. The game was an iteration for a previous game called **LikWit**, and a small team was working on it for a couple of months. We wanted a clean and smart-looking style for the game, keeping everything minimalist but beautiful.

In the end, the company discarded this project to focus on different projects.
