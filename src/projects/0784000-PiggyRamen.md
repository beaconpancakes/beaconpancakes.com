When I finished the **Croissant Taiyaki** (that you could see [here](/projects/croissant-taiyaki-a-breakfast-in-tokyo/)), I soon started to look for another cute food to model. And I remembered that I had been not so much ago in a good restaurant wich mix Asiatic and Spanish food. The fact I remember most was a ramen dish served in an incredibly cute pig bowl! I already had my model!

In a way, it was similar to the taiyaki, but it has more textures, more polygons and more complexity. I always prefer to maintain the model low poly so, for me, the hand-painted textures are the best way. And it is also the way I enjoy the more! These textures were challenging because I wanted them to differentiate from each other but preserving unity. This allowed me to experiment with the materials of **Blender** and to learn more about them.

I am happy with the results and I hope I could get all the cuteness from the real thing!
