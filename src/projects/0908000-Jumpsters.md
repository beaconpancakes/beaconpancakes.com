Here you can see some characters, enemies, and general art I made for the mobile game **Jumpsters**, developed by **HeYou Games**.

The creation process was of interest. First, I created the assets in **Adobe Illustrator**, and next, I retouched them in **Adobe Photoshop**. Later, I exported them as splines, and I transform everything to 3D meshes in **Autodesk 3ds Max**. The last step was the exportation to **Unity**, the game engine we used.

As the only artist in the team, I created all the art in the game, from concept to final implementation. Also, I wrote all the processes and pipelines.
