I made this fan art of Sorceress **Yennefer of Vengerberg**, the character from the novel series **The Witcher** written by **Andrzej Sapkowski**, and I had a great time with all the details and the different shades of black. This drawing is one of my firsts with no previous sketches made with pencil and paper, so I always think of it dearly.

It took a long time to finish it, but I am happy with the result.
