This one is a quick and funny sketch of an old character from a comic contest. I conceived it along with my husband (at that time, just boyfriend) since we teamed up for the competition. The name of the character is **Isaac**, and he is a space pirate.

I find him quite interesting, and I still draw him from time to time in my old and beloved drawing notebook.
