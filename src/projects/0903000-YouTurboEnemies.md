These are some of the enemies I made for the mobile video game **YouTurbo**, developed by **HeYou Games**. They were created in **Adobe Photoshop** and exported into several pieces to **Unity**, where we mounted and animated them for the game.

As the older artist in the team, I wrote all the processes and pipelines. Also, I helped to train the new teammates.

We created more than 900 enemies for this game. That was an average of 30 enemies per artist per week.
