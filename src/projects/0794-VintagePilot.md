I have recently visited an art exhibition of a great Spanish painter called [Ram√≥n Casas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Casas) and looking at the way he painted women, I wanted to make something similar but with my style. A strong and funny woman who can achieve anything!

So I decided to make a female vintage pilot, based in old photographs of WW2 pilots. I also tried to come up with an interesting combination of textures (hair, leather, smoke). I finished it really quick, with the magic of the transparent brushes of **Photoshop** and I am particularly pleased with the blonde hair.

Hope you enjoy the process!
