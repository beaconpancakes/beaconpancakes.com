Work In Progress for a blue dragon illustration in which I have been working for fun. It is a painting made only with Photoshop, with no lines, and playing with the lights, shadows and textures. It had a lot of work and still it isn't finished.

The funny thing is that the nickname of the dragon is Tooth Albert (or Diente Alberto, in Spanish)! I cannot help to laugh when I hear it!
