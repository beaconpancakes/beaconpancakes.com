Complex and beautiful blue dragon illustration in which I have been working for fun. It is a painting made only with Photoshop, with no lines, and playing with the lights, shadows, and textures. It had a lot of work, especially in the scales, but I like the colors and the treatment of the shadows.

The funny thing is that I called the dragon with a nickname: **Tooth Albert** (or **Diente Alberto**, in Spanish)! I cannot help but laugh when I hear it!
