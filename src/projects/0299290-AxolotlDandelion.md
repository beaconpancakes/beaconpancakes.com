This is a fun sketch I did blending an axolotl and a dandelion plant (it is clear I love these animals, just check [here](/projects/alien-axolotl/)). I wanted to explore how could have evolved an axolotl if it would live on the surface instead of underwater. I thought that since it is small, it would have to blend into the environment, so it was suitable to look like a plant!

I used a fast unpolished technique with very presence green hues, and a few dashes of violets, yellows and blues. I like the result, particularly for quick drawings, and I am certain I will use this technique again.
