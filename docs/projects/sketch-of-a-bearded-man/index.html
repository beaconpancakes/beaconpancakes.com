    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;A lot of things happened in the last few months. My family and I &lt;strong&gt;managed to move to the United States&lt;/strong&gt;, and we had had a busy time adapting to the new country and the new situation. If you have visited my website before January 2021, you would see many differences, because I also have been working hard to update it. Now there is also a &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;/blog/&quot;&gt;blog section&lt;/a&gt; where I can write about my American adventures (for now, just in Spanish, sorry!). Please, be sure to check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Since I have been busy, I had have little time for drawing just for fun. And I was craving for painting, especially since I got a new &lt;strong&gt;Cintiq Pro&lt;/strong&gt; and I needed to test it out! I have been doing a lot of research on watercolor-like brushes in Photoshop for a commission and having a lot of fun with it. This drawing is a quick sketch that takes roughly one hour and a half and was created with these same watercolor brushes set. The initial goal was to make it in just one color shade, but I started to play with splashes of colors and the blending of the Photoshop layers. I loved the result and decided to stop drawing further because I was already fairly happy with the textures, the strokes from the brushes, and the shading.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By the way, I drew this without any references. But in the process, he started to reminds me of a character in &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/?ref_&#x3D;fn_al_tt_1&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Expanse&lt;/strong&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; played by actor &lt;strong&gt;Wes Chatham&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe this is an unconscious fanart!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
