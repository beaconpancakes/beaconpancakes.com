    &lt;p&gt;When my husband said that, I knew I just &lt;em&gt;have to draw it&lt;/em&gt;! I chose an ink brush in &lt;strong&gt;Affinity&lt;/strong&gt; and just started to draw.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It was a fun and fast drawing (it took me just an afternoon to make it) because I had the concept clear in my mind. I just had to look for pangolin references to understand the scale distribution and growth. The rest of the drawing was easy to create.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was remarkably happy with the line. But when later I tried to colorize the drawing, I was not convinced with the result. Just the line was fresh and funny and dynamic, and the color feels so much stable and excessively crafted. So finally, I decided to get rid of the color layer, and everything feels better again.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes it is better just to go back to the first attempt!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
