    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;These are a couple of sketches of girls reading, casually. I wanted to draw something not very detailed, but with lots of color.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At first, I roughly wanted to draw something blue and cold. I started to do sketches in &lt;strong&gt;Affinity&lt;/strong&gt; and the first girl comes quickly and naturally, with just the line. But I did not want the line this time, so I turned to &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt; and started to work on the colors. I soon forget the line and defined the shapes, trying to find a cartoon-like style. I did not want the usual pretty girl! The shading was smooth and gratifying, so I decided to make another sketch. This time, I chose the concepts warm and orange, and I thought it had to oppose the previous one. So I made her reading on a smartphone and put her the same clothes, like a school uniform, to have something in common.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think there is a story here, between these two. Maybe I should investigate it?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

          <h3>Reading Girls Sketches</h3>
          <p>These are a couple of sketches of girls reading, casually. I wanted to draw something not very detailed, but with lots of color.</p>
<p>At first, I roughly wanted to draw something blue and cold. I started to do sketches in <strong>Affinity</strong> and the first girl comes quickly and naturally, with just the line. But I did not want the line this time, so I turned to <strong>Photoshop</strong> and started to work on the colors. I soon forget the line and defined the shapes, trying to find a cartoon-like style. I did not want the usual pretty girl! The shading was smooth and gratifying, so I decided to make another sketch. This time, I chose the concepts warm and orange, and I thought it had to oppose the previous one. So I made her reading on a smartphone and put her the same clothes, like a school uniform, to have something in common.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
