    <meta property="og:description" content="&lt;p&gt;I make a lot of jokes about goblins because I find them funny and I like their green skin and the ugliness of their teeth and noses. Some time ago, I was thinking in the kings of different creatures, and I imagined how the princess of the goblins would look like. Would she enjoy wearing those inflated pink dresses, like traditional princesses? I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was thinking about creating something more elaborate since I did not make any complex drawing for some time. Then, the idea of the Goblin Princess started to come to my mind. I wanted to do something challenging and engaging for me to complete it, instead of getting bored and left it unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My idea was to get the weariest appearance possible and to play with the beautiful contrasts between the shades of greens and pinks. I also decided not to use lines, only colors, using a more realistic technique. The illumination of the scene was also significant as it defines the main parts of the figure and gives deepness.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The complete drawing took me a month roughly, mainly because I did not work on it all days. But it has a fair amount of work and fun in it!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
